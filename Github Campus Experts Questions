What are your hobbies?
My hobbies include studying Novels, Coding, gaming and racing.

What's your story? Why are you interested in building communities?
My story is one of LOST OPPORTUNITIES. 
I Studied from the school where no one aware of Coding and their future scope.
The community that I grew up in only ever attained certain educations. For example, I wanted to learn how to code in middle school/junior high through high school, but we never had those opportunities available to us that we could use as our motivation to learn new skills. I want to build a community not so much for other students around my age (college), as much as I would like to create a community for those kids who are as old as I was when I first wanted to code with specific targets on those kids who can't afford any opportunities.
