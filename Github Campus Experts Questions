INTRODUCE YOURSELF ->


What's your name?
My name is Sunny Chaudhary.


Where and what do you study?
I study Electronics and Communication Engineering at KIET Group of Institutions, Ghaziabad.


What are your hobbies?
My hobbies include studying Novels, Coding, Gaming and Racing.


What's your story? Why are you interested in building communities?
My story is one of LOST OPPORTUNITIES. 
I Studied from the school where no one aware of Coding and their future scope.
The community that I grew up in only ever attained certain educations. 
For example, I wanted to learn how to code in middle school/junior high through high school, but we never had those opportunities available to us that we could use as our motivation to learn new skills. 
I want to build a community not so much for other students around my age (college), as much as I would like to create a community for those kids who are as old as I was when I first wanted to code with specific targets on those kids who can't afford any opportunities.
