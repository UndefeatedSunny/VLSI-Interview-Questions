## Introduction to this exercise

In this exercise you will:
- Introduce the community that you will be working with.
- Identify the shared struggle of community members.
- Start to think about how you can future-proof the community.

For each header in this document, give as much detail as possible about your community. Leave the headers in, and write your content below them. This essay should form a starting point for the activities you'll do as a Campus Expert.

## Introduce yourself

Before we begin - tell us a bit about yourself.

- What's your name?
  My name is Sunny Chaudhary.
- Where and what do you study?
  I study Electronics and Communication Engineering at KIET Group of Institutions, Ghaziabad.
- What are your hobbies?
  My hobbies include studying Novels, Coding, Gaming and Racing.
- What's your story? Why are you interested in building communities?
  My story is one of LOST OPPORTUNITIES. 
I Studied from the school where no one aware of Coding and their future scope.
The community that I grew up in only ever attained certain educations. 
For example, I wanted to learn how to code in middle school/junior high through high school, but we never had those opportunities available to us that we could use as our motivation to learn new skills. 
I want to build a community not so much for other students around my age (college), as much as I would like to create a community for those kids who are as old as I was when I first wanted to code with specific targets on those kids who can't afford any opportunities.

## Community Definition

How would you define your community? Try to be open minded, but here are some examples of ways you could define your community:

- Is it a computer science club or special interest group?
- Is it a formally recognized community such as a student society, or is it an informal community such as a friendship group?
- Does your community share interests or an environment?
- How long has your community existed?
- How big is your community? Has it always been this size?

## What are your community's shared struggles?

- What are the problems that is or will bring your community members together? They can be anything, but are commonly focussed around working towards better skills, grades or jobs.

## What is the mission of your community?
 - Based on your community's shared struggled, what is your community's mission? Keep this short and snappy.
- Note: this is not your personal mission, but the overarching mission of your community. An example of a mission might be `'Our aim is the equip everyone, regardless of their major, with technical skills to increase their job prospects.'`

## What do members look to get from your community?
