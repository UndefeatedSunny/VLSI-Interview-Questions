## Introduce yourself

Before we begin - tell us a bit about yourself.

- What's your name?

My name is Sunny Chaudhary.

- Where and what do you study?

I study Electronics and Communication Engineering at KIET Group of Institutions, Ghaziabad.

- What are your hobbies?

My hobbies include studying Novels, Coding, Gaming and Racing.
- What's your story? Why are you interested in building communities?

My story is one of LOST OPPORTUNITIES. 
I Studied from the school where no one aware of Coding and their future scope.
The community that I grew up in only ever attained certain educations. 
For example, I wanted to learn how to code in middle school/junior high through high school, but we never had those opportunities available to us that we could use as our motivation to learn new skills. 
I want to build a community not so much for other students around my age (college), as much as I would like to create a community for those kids who are as old as I was when I first wanted to code with specific targets on those kids who can't afford any opportunities.

## Community Definition

How would you define your community? Try to be open minded, but here are some examples of ways you could define your community:

- Is it a computer science club or special interest group?

It's a combination of both computer science and Special interest group like Hobby groups will help us to create a diverse community with specific groups for trending technologies. This will also increase community interaction and knowledge transfer among students.

- Is it a formally recognized community such as a student society, or is it an informal community such as a friendship group?

It a formally recognized community such as a student society but include friendship zones as it is the major part of any successful community.

- Does your community share interests or an environment?

YES, My community share interests depends whether it related to coding or any new technology that provide benefits to whole community.

- How long has your community existed?

It's the starting (approx. 6 months) as there is no other group in our college that work on Git that i mentioned above in my discription.

- How big is your community? Has it always been this size?

Community Size is approx. 25 Students. Yes, the size remains the same.

## What are your community's shared struggles?

- What are the problems that is or will bring your community members together? They can be anything, but are commonly focussed around working towards better skills, grades or jobs.

 INTERNSHIP is the major issue that makes students to work on open source and make it capable to achieve that goal.
 
 Effecting Group events makes CODING EXPERIENCE levels maximization or improvement.
 
 SKILLS improved like Soft Skills and communication , as it is also the major part of any community.
 
## THIS MAKES COMMUNITY MEMBERS TOGETHER.
